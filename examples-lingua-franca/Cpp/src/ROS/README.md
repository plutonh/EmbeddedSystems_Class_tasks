This is an LF reimplementation of the ROS 2 minimal publisher and sunscriber
[example](https://docs.ros.org/en/galactic/Tutorials/Writing-A-Simple-Cpp-Publisher-And-Subscriber.html).

It consists of two LF files, MinimalPublisher and MinimalSubscriber, each
implementing the corresponding nodes from the original example.
