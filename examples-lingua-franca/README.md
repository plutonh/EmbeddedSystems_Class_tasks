This repository contains example Lingua Franca programs that are useful to get to know the language.
The examples are organized by target language:

* [C](C/README.md): C target language
* [CCpp](CCpp/src/README.md): C/C++ target, which is the C target using a C++ compiler.


**NOTE: This is a work in progress.**
These examples may not keep up with changes in the language and compiler.
See the regression tests for validated examples.
